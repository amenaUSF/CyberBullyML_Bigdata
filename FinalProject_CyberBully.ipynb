If you are trying to find religion things must be worse then even I think they are.  Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always said a little religion is a good thing, but in your case it just looks fake, kind of like when you play golf.  You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in God.  You believe in the God of Government.  With the first commandment being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThou shalt pay confiscatory taxes such that resting on the Sabbath is not even an option.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Now that the riff raff have been kicked out of the private school, I guess that whole charity thing is shot too.  Maybe, if you say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHope and Change\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a few times you might convince those kids that they are suffering for you, and their sacrifice to the God of Government will not be in vein.\\n\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get back to the Government God, the protector and defender of all that is graft and collusion.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to hand it to all of you and especially Blagojevich, I am impressed, not only have you committed rape, and pillage upon \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe The People,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but some of them thank you for it, they even get on a bus, and spit on people I really respect for you as you put in place the very plans that will destroy them.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really impressive, Bernie Maddoff, has nothing on all of you. The lot of you could screw a hooker and convince her to pay for it!  Now, your God of Government is upset with you Mr. Obama, and frankly, while I may be impressed, he is not.\\n\\nWhy is this so?  For one thing The United States of America is still here, chugging along with all the accumulated dead weight that liberal democrats have heaved upon her.  Government God is also upset that the people still have a voice, he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that.  You, as his surrogate, should stop all free speech immediately; tell Kathleen Sebelious to issue another communiqu\\xc3\\xa9 threatening the CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s of insurance companies with summary execution unless they place the blame for higher premiums on those that truly deserve it; breast cancer patients, and further, that it is wholly unsatisfactory that they should live another day - The God of Government commands it to you Mr. Obama, you will obey.\\n\\nThe bigger cheese is likely also upset at the Godless turn of events in God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s country.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the Lord your God . . . You shall have no other God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s before me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Boy, have you screwed that one up.  I imagine that is a big one with the man upstairs.  You see, God works his will through the faithful, and not those like yourself who pray to false Gods and bear false witness on a daily basis - you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what the truth is anymore.    Hell, they even got you thinking you fight \\xe2\\x80\\x9cterrorists\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by killing one side of the same Arab coin.  Whose the fool Barrak, you, or me?  Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answer that, we know the answer. \\n\\nWell in 44 days the God of Government is going to have another problem.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe The People\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are going into those polls, and we are going to fire the first shots in the shape of ballots at your Government God, and we are going to put God back where He belongs.  If this crop of politicians falls for the God of Government, we will just do it all again, we will be relentless, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe will not weaken or tire,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d we were given the tools by our founding fathers and we have deployed them against you to good affect.  Remember, it only takes one person to shut the whole freak show down.  I cannot wait to see the curtain come down on the latest installment of liberalism run amok, I have to say, the sequel was worse than the original.

If you are trying to find religion things must be worse then even I think they are.  Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always said a little religion is a good thing, but in your case it just looks fake, kind of like when you play golf.  You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in God.  You believe in the God of Government.  With the first commandment being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThou shalt pay confiscatory taxes such that resting on the Sabbath is not even an option.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Now that the riff raff have been kicked out of the private school, I guess that whole charity thing is shot too.  Maybe, if you say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHope and Change\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a few times you might convince those kids that they are suffering for you, and their sacrifice to the God of Government will not be in vein.\\n\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get back to the Government God, the protector and defender of all that is graft and collusion.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to hand it to all of you and especially Blagojevich, I am impressed, not only have you committed rape, and pillage upon \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe The People,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but some of them thank you for it, they even get on a bus, and spit on people I really respect for you as you put in place the very plans that will destroy them.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really impressive, Bernie Maddoff, has nothing on all of you. The lot of you could screw a hooker and convince her to pay for it!  Now, your God of Government is upset with you Mr. Obama, and frankly, while I may be impressed, he is not.\\n\\nWhy is this so?  For one thing The United States of America is still here, chugging along with all the accumulated dead weight that liberal democrats have heaved upon her.  Government God is also upset that the people still have a voice, he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that.  You, as his surrogate, should stop all free speech immediately; tell Kathleen Sebelious to issue another communiqu\\xc3\\xa9 threatening the CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s of insurance companies with summary execution unless they place the blame for higher premiums on those that truly deserve it; breast cancer patients, and further, that it is wholly unsatisfactory that they should live another day - The God of Government commands it to you Mr. Obama, you will obey.\\n\\nThe bigger cheese is likely also upset at the Godless turn of events in God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s country.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the Lord your God . . . You shall have no other God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s before me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Boy, have you screwed that one up.  I imagine that is a big one with the man upstairs.  You see, God works his will through the faithful, and not those like yourself who pray to false Gods and bear false witness on a daily basis - you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what the truth is anymore.    Hell, they even got you thinking you fight \\xe2\\x80\\x9cterrorists\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by killing one side of the same Arab coin.  Whose the fool Barrak, you, or me?  Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answer that, we know the answer. \\n\\nWell in 44 days the God of Government is going to have another problem.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe The People\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are going into those polls, and we are going to fire the first shots in the shape of ballots at your Government God, and we are going to put God back where He belongs.  If this crop of politicians falls for the God of Government, we will just do it all again, we will be relentless, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe will not weaken or tire,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d we were given the tools by our founding fathers and we have deployed them against you to good affect.  Remember, it only takes one person to shut the whole freak show down.  I cannot wait to see the curtain come down on the latest installment of liberalism run amok, I have to say, the sequel was worse than the original.

19 2010\\n\\nDear President Obama,\\n\\nI read that you went to church, on Sunday no less, without Reverend Wright.  If you are trying to find religion things must be worse then even I think they are.  Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always said a little religion is a good thing, but in your case it just looks fake, kind of like when you play golf.  You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in God.  You believe in the God of Government.  With the first commandment being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThou shalt pay confiscatory taxes such that resting on the Sabbath is not even an option.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Now that the riff raff have been kicked out of the private school, I guess that whole charity thing is shot too.  Maybe, if you say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHope and Change\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a few times you might convince those kids that they are suffering for you, and their sacrifice to the God of Government will not be in vein.\\n\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get back to the Government God, the protector and defender of all that is graft and collusion.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to hand it to all of you and especially Blagojevich, I am impressed, not only have you committed rape, and pillage upon \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe The People,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but some of them thank you for it, they even get on a bus, and spit on people I really respect for you as you put in place the very plans that will destroy them.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really impressive, Bernie Maddoff, has nothing on all of you. The lot of you could screw a hooker and convince her to pay for it!  Now, your God of Government is upset with you Mr. Obama, and frankly, while I may be impressed, he is not.\\n\\nWhy is this so?  For one thing The United States of America is still here, chugging along with all the accumulated dead weight that liberal democrats have heaved upon her.  Government God is also upset that the people still have a voice, he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that.  You, as his surrogate, should stop all free speech immediately; tell Kathleen Sebelious to issue another communiqu\\xc3\\xa9 threatening the CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s of insurance companies with summary execution unless they place the blame for higher premiums on those that truly deserve it; breast cancer patients, and further, that it is wholly unsatisfactory that they should live another day - The God of Government commands it to you Mr. Obama, you will obey.\\n\\nThe bigger cheese is likely also upset at the Godless turn of events in God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s country.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the Lord your God . . . You shall have no other God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s before me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Boy, have you screwed that one up.  I imagine that is a big one with the man upstairs.  You see, God works his will through the faithful, and not those like yourself who pray to false Gods and bear false witness on a daily basis - you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what the truth is anymore.    Hell, they even got you thinking you fight \\xe2\\x80\\x9cterrorists\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by killing one side of the same Arab coin.  Whose the fool Barrak, you, or me?  Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answer that, we know the answer. \\n\\nWell in 44 days the God of Government is going to have another problem.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe The People\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are going into those polls, and we are going to fire the first shots in the shape of ballots at your Government God, and we are going to put God back where He belongs.  If this crop of politicians falls for the God of Government, we will just do it all again, we will be relentless, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe will not weaken or tire,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d we were given the tools by our founding fathers and we have deployed them against you to good affect.  Remember, it only takes one person to shut the whole freak show down.  I cannot wait to see the curtain come down on the latest installment of liberalism run amok, I have to say, the sequel was worse than the original.

Obama,\\n\\nI read that you went to church, on Sunday no less, without Reverend Wright.  If you are trying to find religion things must be worse then even I think they are.  Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always said a little religion is a good thing, but in your case it just looks fake, kind of like when you play golf.  You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in God.  You believe in the God of Government.  With the first commandment being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThou shalt pay confiscatory taxes such that resting on the Sabbath is not even an option.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Now that the riff raff have been kicked out of the private school, I guess that whole charity thing is shot too.  Maybe, if you say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHope and Change\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a few times you might convince those kids that they are suffering for you, and their sacrifice to the God of Government will not be in vein.\\n\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get back to the Government God, the protector and defender of all that is graft and collusion.  I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to hand it to all of you and especially Blagojevich, I am impressed, not only have you committed rape, and pillage upon \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe The People,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but some of them thank you for it, they even get on a bus, and spit on people I really respect for you as you put in place the very plans that will destroy them.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really impressive, Bernie Maddoff, has nothing on all of you. The lot of you could screw a hooker and convince her to pay for it!  Now, your God of Government is upset with you Mr. Obama, and frankly, while I may be impressed, he is not.\\n\\nWhy is this so?  For one thing The United States of America is still here, chugging along with all the accumulated dead weight that liberal democrats have heaved upon her.  Government God is also upset that the people still have a voice, he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that.  You, as his surrogate, should stop all free speech immediately; tell Kathleen Sebelious to issue another communiqu\\xc3\\xa9 threatening the CEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s of insurance companies with summary execution unless they place the blame for higher premiums on those that truly deserve it; breast cancer patients, and further, that it is wholly unsatisfactory that they should live another day - The God of Government commands it to you Mr. Obama, you will obey.\\n\\nThe bigger cheese is likely also upset at the Godless turn of events in God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s country.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI am the Lord your God . . . You shall have no other God\\xe2\\x80\\x99s before me.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Boy, have you screwed that one up.  I imagine that is a big one with the man upstairs.  You see, God works his will through the faithful, and not those like yourself who pray to false Gods and bear false witness on a daily basis - you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what the truth is anymore.    Hell, they even got you thinking you fight \\xe2\\x80\\x9cterrorists\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by killing one side of the same Arab coin.  Whose the fool Barrak, you, or me?  Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answer that, we know the answer. \\n\\nWell in 44 days the God of Government is going to have another problem.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe The People\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are going into those polls, and we are going to fire the first shots in the shape of ballots at your Government God, and we are going to put God back where He belongs.  If this crop of politicians falls for the God of Government, we will just do it all again, we will be relentless, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe will not weaken or tire,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d we were given the tools by our founding fathers and we have deployed them against you to good affect.  Remember, it only takes one person to shut the whole freak show down.  I cannot wait to see the curtain come down on the latest installment of liberalism run amok, I have to say, the sequel was worse than the original.
